    content: >
      The drawing application is a tool for designing dynamic web content. The application allows users to create and manipulate shapes on a 2D canvas using CSS. The shapes are organized into a document that contains a list of objects to be drawn in a specific order. Currently, only rectangles are supported, but in the future, the list will include other shapes and object types, such as videos.

      The canvas is a single sheet containing a 2D space for holding objects, and the document will consist of a list of these objects to be drawn in a specific order.

      The drawing application also includes a set of tools used for supporting editing operations. These tools have states, including the current color and mode.
